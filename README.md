# Theme: EDAMAM Recipe Search API
This was the Python Project I completed for Code First Girl's final presentation for the Python Kickstarter Course, utilising EDAMAM's API to search for recipes by inputting the desired ingredients.

# Project Overview
I'm planning to bake a cake for my friend's birthday. However, there are certain ingredients to which my friend is allergic. Since I'm currently learning Python, I'll use it to help me check for the ingredients to which my friend is NOT allergic.

I'll then use Edamam's API to help me search for cake recipes that not only taste delicious but also accommodate my friend's food allergies. By entering the required ingredients, this function will return a list of recipes that use the entered ingredients.
